NextSaaS Funnels provided detailed, granular insights into user actions across their signup flow.\n"},"problemBlock":{"titleOne":"The problem","titleTwo":"Unknown friction in key user flows.","description":"Despite strong traffic, many users abandoned the process before publishing a website. Legacy tools lacked the depth to show where users got stuck. The growth team knew that users were dropping off during onboarding, but could not pinpoint exactly which steps were causing frustration. Without granular funnel analytics, it was impossible to identify whether the issue was template selection, domain setup, payment processing, or content creation.

NextSaaS Analytics provided a unified data layer that eliminated reporting delays and improved operational visibility.\n"},"problemBlock":{"titleOne":"The problem","titleTwo":"Fragmented systems slowed decision-making.","description":"Multiple independent data pipelines made reconciliation slow and error-prone. Stripe needed a scalable analytics solution capable of processing millions of events in real time with zero engineering overhead. Payment data lived in separate systems for transactions, settlements, fraud detection, and customer support, making it difficult to get a complete picture of payment health. Finance teams spent days each week reconciling data from different sources, and by the time reports were ready, the information was often outdated. This delay prevented rapid response to payment issues or fraud patterns.\n","testimonial":{"image":"/images/ns-avatar-4.png","name":"Maria Thompson","role":"Finance Ops Lead, Stripe","description":"NextSaaS cut our reporting time dramatically.
