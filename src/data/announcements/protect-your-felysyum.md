At Felysyum, we take pride in the success of our cryptocurrency projects. However, with growth comes challenges, and one of the biggest issues we face is the rise of scam and fake tokens across multiple networks.

### Felysyum’s Original Currency
The official and only authentic Felysyum currency is deployed on the Polygon network with the smart contract address: `0xee997788f625809332baabb3110bcf1ba7400824`. Any other token claiming to be Felysyum on a different network is fraudulent.

### Stay Vigilant – Protect Yourself from Scams
As Felysyum gains more recognition, scammers create fake tokens to mislead investors. Some of these fraudulent tokens currently in circulation include:
- `3eb38F8LNfz3THkCiKY427wdE1n2MsSNdzTQaCaHpump`
- `R2B5zMLrMmB1hj7tJ2UH4yzwTKknKLPjbmkSR64pump`
- `9wNphGAgPLmSZjoTNMEEFSXArN8KKaR6zZ5Sss8Upump`

To protect yourself and others in the community, always verify the smart contract address before making any transactions. If a token is not on the Polygon network under our official contract, it is NOT part of Felysyum.

### Fighting Fake Tokens
We are actively working to report and take down these scam tokens from the networks they are built on. However, the most effective way to combat this issue is through awareness and education.

### How You Can Help
- **Verify Before You Invest:** Always check the smart contract address.
- **Educate the Community:** Share this information with fellow investors to prevent them from falling into scams.
- **Report Fake Tokens:** If you come across a suspicious token, report it to us and the respective network.

### Final Reminder
Do not be misled by fake tokens. Only trust the official Felysyum currency on the Polygon network (Contract: `0xee997788f625809332baabb3110bcf1ba7400824`). Your security is our priority, and together, we can eliminate fraudulent activities from the crypto space.

Stay informed. Stay safe. Stay with Felysyum.
